# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31st, 2020
##### (May the odds be forever in my favor)

**Today's Progress**: Migrated my first Sololearn HTML/CSS project to my repository

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 1st, 2020
##### (First Day of Full Moon in Pisces)

**Today's Progress**: Getting past 50% on the HTML Course on Sololearn. Tied in a challenge from Sololearn. Watched a video on python to stay used to it's syntax.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to get SOMETHING done today so I knocked out more of the Sololearn course. I don't really have anything else to build just yet but will be looking to combine my existing python knowledge to create some back-end for my front end tech. I learned about the new elements in HTML5. API is in HTML5 so maybe that's why it's so much more dynamic? I also remember seeing geolocation as part of the API integration. This is pretty eye opening from my experience using a web browser for work and having sites I visit ocassionally ask me permission for my geolocation. I always assumed it was javascript or java but now I know it's HTML5 communicating directly with API. I also retained quite a bit of my HTML 4 knowledge from my coding days on Angelfire, Geocities, and even Myspace. I remember learning most things from Mozilla Codemonkey articles and they also had a dictionary for the syntax/language I believe. It's pretty dope today having resources like sololearn, w3schools, CodeAcademy, etc. These resources, plus a few programming friends, practice, and determination really revolutionizes one's ability to learn.

### Day 0: September 4th, 2020
##### (Starting over)

**Today's Progress**: Progress in my "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" class through MITx EDX.

**Thoughts**: As per the rules of this challenge I am starting over; but that's ok because I really wanted to do this challenge mainly with Python anyways. It's like my own personal little bootcamp to focus strictly on Python for the next 100 days. Life is crazy but I need to stay committed. 

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing to share just yet, but in the future I will upload my code from completed exercises.
