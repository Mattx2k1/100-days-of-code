# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31st, 2020
##### (May the odds be forever in my favor)

**Today's Progress**: Migrated my first Sololearn HTML/CSS project to my repository

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 1st, 2020
##### (First Day of Full Moon in Pisces)

**Today's Progress**: Getting past 50% on the HTML Course on Sololearn. Tied in a challenge from Sololearn. Watched a video on python to stay used to it's syntax.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to get SOMETHING done today so I knocked out more of the Sololearn course. I don't really have anything else to build just yet but will be looking to combine my existing python knowledge to create some back-end for my front end tech. I learned about the new elements in HTML5. API is in HTML5 so maybe that's why it's so much more dynamic? I also remember seeing geolocation as part of the API integration. This is pretty eye opening from my experience using a web browser for work and having sites I visit ocassionally ask me permission for my grolocation. I always assumed it was javascript or java but now I know it's HTML5 communicating directly with API. I also retained quite a bit of my HTML 4 knowledge from my coding days on Angelfire, Geocities, and even Myspace. I remember learning most things from Mozilla Codemonkey articles and they also had a dictionary for the syntax/language I believe. It's pretty dope today having resources like sololearn, w3schools, CodeAcademy, etc. These resources, plus a few programming friends, practice, and determination really revolutionizes one's ability to learn.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
